Hi I developed Kaiju as a task manager to keep productive. With Kaiju you can create, read, update, and delete tasks. These tasks can be dragged/dropped between containers. 

Current tech stack includes Typescript, Redux Toolkit, Java Spring, Postgres.

Future features will include notifications, commments, and analytics.
