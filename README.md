Hi I developed Kaiju as a task manager to keep productive. With Kaiju you can create, read, update, and delete tasks. These tasks can be dragged/dropped between containers. 

Current tech stack includes Typescript, Redux Toolkit, Java Spring, Postgres.

Recently new features are Email notifications when creating a task. A Lambda function fires off a notfication that sends an email via SendGrid.

Future features will include commments, and analytics.

Project is hosted at https://kaiju-mke1.onrender.com/
