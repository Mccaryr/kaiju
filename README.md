## Intro 
  Hi I developed Kaiju as a task manager to keep productive. With Kaiju you can create, read, update, and delete tasks. These tasks can be dragged/dropped between containers.  
  **Project is hosted at https://kaiju-mke1.onrender.com/**

## Current tech stack includes:
  Typescript, Redux Toolkit, Java Spring, Postgres.

## New features
  Email notifications when creating a task. A Lambda function fires off a notfication that sends an email via SendGrid.

Future features will include commments, and analytics.



## External Services used: 
  AWS Lamda - notifications  
  Sendgrid/Twilio - notification handling  
  GoDaddy - email hosting  
  Render - website hosting  
  Supabase - DB storage
